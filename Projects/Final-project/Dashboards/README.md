# 📊 Dashboards – Final Project

This folder contains interactive dashboards created as part of the final academic project in Information Systems.

## 🔍 Description

The dashboards visualize cybersecurity attack prediction results based on real Microsoft security data (~23,000 records).  
They illustrate insights from machine learning models used to forecast potential threats, as well as data preprocessing, trends, and predictions over time.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Tableau** for data visualization and dashboard creation
- **Python** for data processing and machine learning modeling
- **Jupyter / PyCharm** for development environment
- **Pandas, Scikit-learn, CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM** for modeling
