# Python Projects Portfolio

Welcome to the **Python** folder of my portfolio repository.  
This directory contains a collection of Python projects and scripts that I have developed as part of my studies and personal learning journey in Information Systems and programming.

## Repository Structure

This folder includes the following subfolders and projects:

- **PdfQuizByGPT/**  
  A project related to creating or managing PDF quizzes, possibly with GPT integration.

- **calculator/**  
  A Python-based calculator implementation demonstrating basic and advanced arithmetic operations.

- **findJob_nvidia/**  
  Scripts or tools related to job search or automation for Nvidia-related positions or data.

- **functionList/**  
  A collection of Python functions for various tasks, utilities, or demonstrations.

- **my_help_library/**  
  A personal Python helper library with reusable functions or classes to support other projects.

- **prime_number/**

## Highlights

- Each folder contains a focused project or set of scripts demonstrating different Python skills such as algorithms, utilities, mathematical modeling, or practical applications.

- The projects showcase hands-on experience with Python programming, algorithm implementation, and code organization.

- The structure is intended to be modular, so each folder can be explored independently.
