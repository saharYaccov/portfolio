# ⚽🏆 Champions League Dataset & Dashboards

## 🧠 Overview
This repository contains datasets and dashboards related to the **UEFA Champions League**,  
focusing on match statistics, predictive modeling, and probability analysis.

The data enables exploration of:
- Match outcomes (home/away results, goals, assists, cards, possession, etc.)
- Predictive models for match results and scoring probabilities
- Aggregated insights across multiple seasons of the competition

## 📊 Data Files
- **`all_df_total.xlsx`** – Full dataset containing raw and processed match-level data, including goals, assists, fouls, possession, and advanced statistics.  
- **`predict.xlsx`** – Model prediction results, including win/draw/loss probabilities and player performance forecasts.  
- **`probaDF.xlsx`** – Probability distributions generated by predictive models, useful for visualization and comparison.  

---

## 🔧 Use Cases
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Build BI dashboards in Tableau / Power BI / Plotly Dash.  
- **Predictive Analytics**: Train and test models (Random Forest, CatBoost, LightGBM, etc.) on historical Champions League data.  
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Study trends in goals, cards, substitutions, and possession.  
- **Data Storytelling**: Present insights for sports analytics projects, reports, or fan engagement platforms.  

---

## 📌 Notes
- All datasets are provided in **Excel (XLSX)** format for easy integration.  
- For reproducibility, ensure Python ≥ 3.10 with libraries: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `optuna`, `catboost`.  
- Probability and prediction files are generated from models trained on match-level features.  

---

## 🚀 Future Work
- Extend dataset with additional seasons (pre-2010 historical records).  
- Add xG (Expected Goals) metrics for deeper tactical insights.  
- Integrate with live API feeds for real-time match predictions.
