## ðŸ§  Overview
The Israeli Knesset Data Dashboards project offers an interactive, data-driven analysis of key public data points concerning the Israeli Parliament and national statistics. These visualizations are designed to provide clarity and actionable insights into complex political and financial subjects for researchers, journalists, and data enthusiasts.

The project encompasses two main analytical sections:

Knesset Loans/Financing Analysis: A detailed breakdown of the volume, source, and distribution of state-guaranteed loans and subsidies (e.g., "State Treasury" vs. "Lender Funds"), with comparisons across fiscal periods (e.g., 2022 vs. 20-21).

Israeli Knesset Elections - The Vote Map: A historical analysis of voting patterns, tracking the total number of votes received by various factions (parties) over time, dating back to the 1950s.

## ðŸ”§ Features
Detailed Financial Breakdown: Utilize a Tree Map to visualize the proportion of loans/funds distributed by different entities and categories, highlighting shifts in resource allocation.

Historical Voting Trends: Display time-series data showing the evolution of party support (votes) from the early years of the Knesset (1950s) to the present day.

Performance Comparison: Bar charts rank and compare the average annual votes of major political factions, revealing long-term political shifts.

Full Interactivity: Users can filter the data by year, specific faction, or loan category for deeper analytical drill-down.

Advanced Visualizations: Effective use of Tableau's features, including Hebrew support and custom layouts, to make complex public data accessible.

## ðŸ›  Data Acquisition & Preparation
Data utilized in these dashboards was sourced from official public data portals and research institutes, primarily acquired through programmatic methods to ensure comprehensive historical coverage and accuracy.

The election data, specifically the historical voting records for each faction, was collected by **programmatically extracting the HTML** from the following source: **[The Israel Democracy Institute (IDI) Elections Page](https://www.idi.org.il/policy/parties-and-elections/)**. This process involved iterating through the data offered for every political party on the site. Additional financial data, specifically concerning state-guaranteed loans and subsidies, was accessed and extracted from the Israeli Open Data platform: **[Open Data - State Guaranteed Loans](https://www.odata.org.il/dataset/f470fa97-ead0-4e54-935d-a192f81c45fb/resource/287ce436-12c1-40af-9a0e-7260f12c123f)**.
